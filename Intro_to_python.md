# Intro to Python
Today over conversation one of my room mates said he was looking into python and that he wanted quality sources, I tried googling but didnt get any concise list for folks to follow, so here is my list.

1) 6.00x Intro to computer science using python by Eric Grimson@MIT at edx.org
2) Python series by David Joyner@Georgia Tech at edx.org
3) Intro to python youtube video by CS50 David Malan

And for tools I think jupyter notebook is the best way to get started with python. Better than the shell.
